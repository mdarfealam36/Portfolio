            <p>The Food Ordering App is a robust and user-friendly mobile application developed using Kotlin, 
                designed to provide users with a seamless food ordering experience. 
                The app integrates with a backend API to fetch real-time data, 
                ensuring users have access to the latest information on restaurants, 
                menus, and order statuses. The main features of the app include viewing all restaurants, 
                searching for specific restaurants, saving favorite restaurants, 
                filtering restaurants based on cost and rating, and accessing previous order history.
